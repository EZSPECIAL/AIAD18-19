Work developed for Agents and Distributed Artificial Intelligence (AIAD).

## Project 1
This delivery concerned the allocation of parking lots to several cars. The cars had certain requirements regarding the kind of spot they preferred and negotiated with the various parking lots to assess which was the best one for them.

## Project 2
Considering the work done in the first project, we were to analyse the satisfaction of each car agent with their chosen parking lot. This was a regression problem which we analysed in RapidMiner by using a dataset with 1000 cars and varying parking lot configurations.
